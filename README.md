# Data Structures

The purpose of this repository is to keep the implementation of some common operations on data structures in one place. Maybe the repo is better off being called Algorithms. Anyway...

Providing a great implementation of a linked list with a tonne of optimized functionality is not the goal of this project, there is no need to implement another linked list. Performing operations on the linked list, and other data structures is something that often comes up in programming challenges. In most cases, you are given a pointer to a node and told to perform some action. For example, reversing a singly linked list in place. It's not likely to be a real world scenario, if it was, you might have chosen an alternate data structure. However, it does test your ability to manipulate pointers. The solution is elegant if you keep a pointer to the previous, current and next node.
