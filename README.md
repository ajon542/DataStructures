# Data Structures

The purpose of this repository is to keep the implementation and operations on some common data structures in one place. Providing a great implementation of a LinkedList with a tonne of optimized functionality is not the goal of this project, there is no need to implement another linked list. Performing operations on the LinkedList is something that often comes up in programming challenges. For example, reversing a singly linked list in place. The solution is elegant if you keep a pointer to the previous, current and next node. Finding the location and length of a cycle in a singly linked list is another example. Again the solution is pretty simple, but the implementation of the solution comes with subtle issues. It would be nice to keep these implementations for future reference.
